--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The minimap
--
-- This module got smaller than the design expected, and both reductions are
-- the right answer rather than a shortcut.
--
-- 1. THIS MODULE MOVES NOTHING. Stock 1.15.9 already anchors the minimap
--    flush to the top right: both Edit Mode preset layouts set the Minimap
--    system to TOPRIGHT / UIParent / TOPRIGHT at offset 0,0, and the XML
--    agrees. There is nothing to move. (Its SIZE is set, but through the Edit
--    Mode layout in Layout.lua, which is the sanctioned route - not from
--    here.)
--
--    The residual gap between the visible ring and the screen edge is not an
--    anchor problem. MinimapCluster is a ResizeLayoutFrame sized to the union
--    of its shown children, and the widest of those is the ~176px BorderTop
--    header, so the header is flush and the 140px map sits inside it. Closing
--    that gap means moving the map relative to its own header, which is a
--    different and much worse idea.
--
--    DragonflightUI's +7 does not transfer. Its own comment says why: it was
--    compensating for dead margin in a 178px frame DragonflightUI created
--    and re-parented the real minimap into. Different frame, different art,
--    different units.
--
--    And MinimapCluster is an Edit Mode system, which makes fighting it
--    actively unpleasant: EditModeSystemMixin swaps SetPoint, ClearAllPoints,
--    SetScale, SetShown and Hide for overrides, so `MinimapCluster:SetPoint`
--    is not the C method and writes manager state in our taint context; the
--    frame is clampedToScreen with zero insets, so a positive offset on a
--    TOPRIGHT anchor cannot move it anyway; and any anchor we did set is
--    reverted on layout save, spec change and every close of Edit Mode.
--    Drag it in Edit Mode instead - that is what Edit Mode is for.
--
-- 2. IT IS NOT A CALENDAR BUTTON ON ERA. Classic Era loads
--    GameTime_NoCalendar, not the Wrath GameTime, so `GameTimeFrame` here is
--    the time-of-day sun/moon dial: a Frame rather than a Button, no OnClick,
--    no enableMouse declared and nothing that ever calls EnableMouse, which
--    makes even its tooltip script unreachable. Hiding it costs the sun icon
--    and saves a per-frame OnUpdate, and it is not protected, not secure and
--    not an Edit Mode system, so a plain Hide() is safe and taint-free.
--
--    The setting keeps the old profile's name so the migration is traceable,
--    but nothing user-facing calls it a calendar.

local function todFrame()
    return _G["GameTimeFrame"]
end

-- Hide is unconditional; Show is not. ToggleMinimap hides the dial along with
-- the map and shows it again on the way back, so an unconditional Show in the
-- restore path would put the sun back on screen with no minimap under it the
-- moment the feature was switched off while the map was toggled away.
-- Blizzard's own state is the authority on whether it should be visible at
-- all, and Minimap:IsShown() is that state.

    if not map or map:IsShown() then f:Show() end
end

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The tracking button
--
-- On Era this is genuinely broken in Blizzard's own XML.
-- Blizzard_Minimap/Classic/MinimapTracking_Simple.xml declares
--   <Frame name="MiniMapTracking" mixin="MinimapTrackingSimpleMixin" hidden="true">
-- with NO parent attribute and an unqualified <Anchor point="TOPLEFT" x="11"
-- y="-26"/>, and MinimapTracking_Simple.lua never reparents it. So it lands
-- at the top-left of the SCREEN, next to the player frame, rather than on the
-- minimap. The non-vanilla variant of the same file has parent="MinimapBackdrop";
-- the vanilla one lost it.
--
-- Only classes with an active tracking ability ever see it, which is why it
-- survives in the shipped client. The offsets are DragonflightUI's, which
-- put it where the tracking button has always sat on the ring.
