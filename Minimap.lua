-- The minimap
--
-- This module got smaller than the design expected, and both reductions are
-- the right answer rather than a shortcut.
--
-- 1. THE CORNER TUCK SHIPS NOTHING. Stock 1.15.9 already anchors the minimap
--    flush to the top right: both Edit Mode preset layouts set the Minimap
--    system to TOPRIGHT / UIParent / TOPRIGHT at offset 0,0, and the XML
--    agrees. There is nothing to move.
--
--    The residual gap between the visible ring and the screen edge is not an
--    anchor problem. MinimapCluster is a ResizeLayoutFrame sized to the union
--    of its shown children, and the widest of those is the ~176px BorderTop
--    header, so the header is flush and the 140px map sits inside it. Closing
--    that gap means moving the map relative to its own header, which is a
--    different and much worse idea.
--
--    DragonflightUI's +7 does not transfer. Its own comment says why: it was
--    compensating for dead margin in a 178px frame DragonflightUI created
--    and re-parented the real minimap into. Different frame, different art,
--    different units.
--
--    And MinimapCluster is an Edit Mode system, which makes fighting it
--    actively unpleasant: EditModeSystemMixin swaps SetPoint, ClearAllPoints,
--    SetScale, SetShown and Hide for overrides, so `MinimapCluster:SetPoint`
--    is not the C method and writes manager state in our taint context; the
--    frame is clampedToScreen with zero insets, so a positive offset on a
--    TOPRIGHT anchor cannot move it anyway; and any anchor we did set is
--    reverted on layout save, spec change and every close of Edit Mode.
--    Drag it in Edit Mode instead - that is what Edit Mode is for.
--
-- 2. IT IS NOT A CALENDAR BUTTON ON ERA. Classic Era loads
--    GameTime_NoCalendar, not the Wrath GameTime, so `GameTimeFrame` here is
--    the time-of-day sun/moon dial: a Frame rather than a Button, no OnClick,
--    no enableMouse declared and nothing that ever calls EnableMouse, which
--    makes even its tooltip script unreachable. Hiding it costs the sun icon
--    and saves a per-frame OnUpdate, and it is not protected, not secure and
--    not an Edit Mode system, so a plain Hide() is safe and taint-free.
--
--    The setting keeps the old profile's name so the migration is traceable,
--    but nothing user-facing calls it a calendar.
